The four of them lived in United States, Ohio for three years for a mission the adults were on to retrieve important information from a S.H.I.E.L.D. organisation and burn the rest.

        ―Madame B. and Natasha Romanoff

        "Looking over your shoulder needs to become a second nature."
        ―Captain America, Scarlet Witch and Black Widow
        "Thanks, Sam."
        "Don't thank me."
        "I'm not thanking that thing."

        "No. Someone will, if you interfere. That's how it works now."
        "If he's this far gone, then... I should be the one to bring him in."
        "Why?"
        "Because I'm the one least likely to die trying."
        ―Natasha Romanoff and Steve Rogers

        ―Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson and Tony Stark
        "What happens when the shooting starts, let them kill Steve Rogers?"

        ―Natasha Romanoff and Thaddeus Ross
        "We're seriously understaffed."
