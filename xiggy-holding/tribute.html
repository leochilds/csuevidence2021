            Born on the 4th of January, 1988 as the son of Elaine Lee, Brennan Lee Mulligan was introduced to Dungeons & Dragons by his mother at age nine, first gamemastering at age ten. In November 2015, Mulligan was a contestant on the American version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and won US$50,000 (equivalent to $54,591 in 2020) after incorrectly answering the $100,000-question. By 2020, he was an alumnus of SUNY Ulster (having majored in philosophy/humanities) and lived in Los Angeles. On January 21, 2021, Mulligan announced his engagement to his fiancée—Izzy Roland—via Instagram.

            For many years, Brennan was the lead writer for the LARPing summer camp, <i>The Wayfinder Experience</i>. He also authored <i>Strong Female Protagonist</i>, a webcomic he created with artist and writer Molly Ostertag. The first pages were published in 2012 and it went on hiatus in 2018, as both creators were too busy to continue the project. <i>SFP</i> acquired a large following over the years, and many still eagerly await the final chapter, whenever it may come.

            Brennan Lee Mulligan is writer, executive producer, and game master of <i>CollegeHumor</i>'s <i>Dimension 20</i>. The actual-play webseries has run three core campaigns (<i>Fantasy High</i>, <i>The Unsleeping City</i>, and <i>A Crown of Candy</i>), and several more Side Quests, including <i>Tiny Heist</i>, <i>Of Mice and Murder</i>, and upcoming season <i>The Seven</i>, which follow a group of NPCs from Fantasy High. It is highly acclaimed for both its creative settings, incredible acting, and relatively short structure. Unlike other actual-play shows, such as <i>Critical Role</i> and <i>The Adventure Zone</i>, <i>D20</i>'s longest seasons only span twenty episodes, making them a much easier introduction to table top games.
